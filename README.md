<h1>Hue Chatbot</h1>
<h3>What is Hue</h3>  
<p>This bot is a personal project utilizing localized generative AI and Natural Language Processing to enhance the chatting expirence, interactivity, and engagement in Twitch chat.</p>
<p>This bot offers iterative improvements compared to the previous jeeves project</p>
<h3>Goal and process</h3>
<p>The main goal of the bot is to blend the line between chatter and chatbot.</p>
<p>Hue works by scanning all incoming messages for a mention of hue or ravhue (no matter the casing). Once a mention is found, a gguf Llama2 variant will be given the message in it's entirety. A users message will (in hopes) be replied to in a conversational way.</p>
<p>The bot attempts to maintain multiple conversations with different users with basic message log calling for context paired with a sentence similarity process for matching context. These systems have a mixed results depending on the topic(s).</p>
<p>A secondary function of the Hue chatbot is to support streaming through quality of life features. Currently, Hue supports queueing music through Spotify.</p>
